## Project information

-  One of the main strong points is the implemented parser. In addition to the required features there is a condition to verify if an ID is already defined. For example a parent node can only have a child node that has already been initiated. Another well implented feature is the heritage of textures and materials between nodes.
- Scene
  - The created scene consist on a simple room with a workplace (represented by a chair, a table and a trash basket), a fireplace and a shelf used for storage.
  - **TODO** relative link
